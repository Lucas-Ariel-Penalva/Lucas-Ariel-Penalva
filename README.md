### Hi there, pleased to meet you ðŸ‘‹

I'm interested in *Programming*, *Literature* and topics related to *Rationality and Heuristics*.

On this Github, you are mostly going to find some of the code I wrote while working with different **Data Structures and Algorithms**.

#### My main languages are Javascript, C# and Python.

I'm also always learning more about **CSS**, **React**, **Vue** and many more Front-end technologies.
