### Hi there, pleased to meet you ðŸ‘‹

I'm interested in *Programming*, *Literature* and topics related to *Rationality and Heuristics*.

On this Github, you are going to find some of the code I wrote while working with different **Data Structures and Algorithms**. I love solving coding puzzles and studying general computer science topics. I decided to upload some of my notes with my code here.

#### My main languages are Javascript, C# and Python.

I'm always learning more about **CSS**, **React**, **Vue** and many more Front-end technologies that can help me build beautiful responsive Websites and Apps.
