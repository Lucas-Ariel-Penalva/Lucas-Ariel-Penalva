### Hi there, pleased to meet you ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about *Programming*, *Literature* and anything related to *Rationality, Psychology, Biology, Heuristics and Epistemology*.

On this Github, you are going to find the code I wrote while working with different **Data Structures and Algorithms**. I love solving coding puzzles and studying general computer science. I'm uploading some of my notes with my code here.

#### I'm currently programming in Javascript, C# and Python, and I'm interested in adopting other languages while I keep improving as a programmer.

I'm always learning more about **CSS**, **React**, **Vue** and many Front-end technologies that can help me build beautiful responsive Websites and Apps.
